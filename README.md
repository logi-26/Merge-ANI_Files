# Merge-ANI_Files
Basic Python script to merge .ani animation files

This script just reads all of the .ani animation files in the current directory (directory of script) and then merges them into a single .ani file.

I created this basic script to help me merge the .ani animation files for the orignal Resident Evil game.
